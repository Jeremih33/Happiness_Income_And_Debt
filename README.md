Happiness Income and Debt States - Data Exploration (Python) and Visualization (Tableau)

The purpose of this project was to explore happiness, income and debt data and explore relationships between these datapoints. These datapoints are broken up by state. Python was chosen to webscrape tables, manipulate our data using dataframes, summarize data and perform some visualizations. For further visualizations, Tableau was chosen to display dashboards of information.

Table of Contents: 
  I. Happiness Income and Debt PPT - this is a powerpoint file which contains audio which narrates my thoughts on the data and information. To automate the process of forwarding through slides, select slide show -> play from beginning 
  II. Code Files Folder 
    A. CSV Files 
      1. State_Financial_Info.csv is read using our python file
      2. total_debt_population_happiness.csv is output by our python file after joining across many dataframes

To read our tableau workbook, we can open our .twbx file with Tableau reader or Tableau Desktop.
Our .ipynb python file can be read in a number of ways. I used google Colab. To use google colab, upload the file to google drive and then head over to colab to open the file. Our state_financial_info.csv will need to uploaded to our files folder.
